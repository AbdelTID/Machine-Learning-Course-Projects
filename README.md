# Machine Learning Projects
This is a Repository containing various projects I carried out while learning different Machine Learning Algorithms

## Projects
### Chatbot
Problem Statement: Create a chatbot for Tesla company that can answer at least 5 questions related to their electric cars. Use Conditional Statements, Nested Ifs, and Loops in your python code, and be creative when forming your question and answers.

In this Project I used simple if-else statements and nested statements to create chatbot script that takes user inputs and gives out various responses

### Restaurant App
Problem Statement: Create a function in python, that will print the steps involved in ordering food using a food delivery app. The function should contain one parameter that accepts the name of the food delivery app (Example: Ubereats, etc.).

Only print basic steps in ordering food like the opening app, user login, select restaurant, select food, select delivery location, payment method, etc.

(The first output statement should be Food delivery by (app name passed as an argument ) and then print the steps involved in ordering food.

Also, inside the function ask the user to input the dish and restaurant he wants to order from, then print a statement at the end, specifying the input details as Ordering (dish name) from (restaurant name).

### Student Performance
Problem Statement: Using the student_performance dataset, perform basic data exploration, data visualization, and data cleaning as described in your course project.

Plot the histogram for gender, math_score and reading_score (Use boxplot to check for outliers for both math_score and reading_score).

Note: Do not remove the outliers as all the scores are important for further data visualization.

Then remove all other columns from the dataset except 'gender', 'test_preparation_course', 'math_score', 'reading_score' and 'writing_score'.

Now check for any null or nan values in the dataset and perform data cleaning if required.

Add one column to calculate the total score by adding the scores obtained in 'math_score', 'reading_score' and 'writing_score'.

Add another column to calculate the average score by dividing the total score by 3.

Now Perform some data visualization to find which gender has a higher average score, also find the average score of students who completed the test_preparation_course vs the students who did not complete it. (Hint: Use bar plot for both the visualizations).
